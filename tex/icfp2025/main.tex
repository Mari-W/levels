  The first draft of Martin-L\"{o}f's type theory proposed the

  avoid the resulting inconsistencies by assuming

  Proof assistants based on type theory support such universe levels
  to varying degree, but they impose restrictions that can make coding

  Specifically, we consider the ramifications of Agda's

  We propose a simple fix that extends Agda's capabilities for handling
  universe levels parametrically up to $\varepsilon_0$.

\subsection{Universes in Agda}
\label{sec:universes-agda}

TODO: typeset in Agda style

Agda contains significant support for an infinite  hierarchy of universes \cite{team25:_agda_languag_refer}. It
provides an abstract datatype LEVEL of universe levels along with
constants ZERO, SUC, and MAX that denote the base-level of the
hierarchy, the successor, and the maximum of two levels.
The level-parametric type $Set~i$ stands for the universe at level $i$
and it obeys the typing
SET i : SET (SUC i)
Base types inhabit the universe $Set~zero$.
Type formation handles universe levels in the same way as finitely
stratified System F \cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Leivant91}. That is,
\begin{itemize}
\item if $A_1 : Set~ i_1$ and $A_2 : Set~i_2$, then $A_1 \to A_2 : Set
  (i_1 \sqcup i_2)$;
\item  if  $\alpha : Set~i$ is a type variable and $A : Set~j$, then
  $\forall \alpha. A : Set (suc~i \sqcup j)$.
\end{itemize}

To avoid inconsistencies, Agda does not allow pattern matching on the
type LEVEL. However, quantification over LEVEL is allowed and results
in a type at level $\omega$ (if the level-typed variable is used in a
significant way). Unfortunately, levels $\omega$ and higher are
\textbf{not} handled in a parametric way in Agda. Rather there are
predefined types $Set_\omega$, $Set_{\omega1}$,
$Set_{\omega2}$, and so on, for the levels $\omega$, $\omega+1$,
$\omega+2$. This design has some limitations, as most 
notions in the standard library (prominently the equality type
and its supporting infrastructure, but also parameteric
types like sums, pairs, lists, and so on) are defined in a level-parametric
way, and thus they cannot be used with SET$_\omega$ 
and higher universe levels.

For convenience, Agda's unification algorithm has special treatment
for the LEVEL datatype and its operators
\cite{team25:_agda_languag_refer}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Idempotence: $a \sqcup a \equiv  a$.
\item 
Associativity: $(a \sqcup b) \sqcup c$ is the same as $a \sqcup (b \sqcup c)$.
\item 
Commutativity: $a \sqcup b$ is the same as $b \sqcup a$.
\item 
Distributivity of SUC over MAX: $suc (a \sqcup b)$ is the same as $suc~ a \sqcup suc~ b$.
\item 
Neutrality of ZERO: $a \sqcup zero$ is the same as $a$.
\item 
Subsumption: $a \sqcup suc~ a$ is the same as $suc~ a$. 
\end{itemize}
In other words, the level structure is a join-semilattice with an
inflationary endomorphism \cite{DBLP:journals/tcs/BezemC22}.

TODO: Cumulativity

\subsection{Ordinals}
\label{sec:ordinals}

Ordinal numbers are an important concept in mathematics and computer
science. They are closely related to well-ordered sets as any
well-ordered set is order-isomorphic to an ordinal. The significance
to computer science is that such well-orders can be used for
termination proofs.

The best known construction of ordinals is a set-theoretic one due to
von Neumann. It starts with the smallest ordinal $0$ represented by
the empty set $\emptyset$. To construct the successor of an ordinal
$\alpha$, we define $\alpha+1  := \alpha \cup \{ \alpha \}$. This way,
we construct $1, 2, 3, \dots$. Then, we can scoop them all up into the
smallest limit ordinal $\omega = \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$, which
contains $0$ and all finite applications of the successor to it. We
continue with $\omega + 1 = \omega \cup \{ \omega \}$ and carry on
until we build the next limit ordinal $\omega \cdot 2$, then $\omega
\cdot 3$, and so on. Constructing the limit at this level yields
$\omega^\omega$ and continuing further leads to
$\omega^{\omega^\omega}$, $\omega^{\omega^{\omega^\omega}}$, and so
on. The limit of this sequence is $\varepsilon_0$ which is the
smallest ordinal that fulfills the equation
$\varepsilon_0 = \omega^{\varepsilon_0}$.

In the context of this paper, we plan to use
ordinals as universe levels where the well-ordering avoids collapsing
levels. The construction of ordinals does not stop at $\varepsilon_0$,
but we wish to carve out a particular set of ordinals that fits
well in an implementation context. Concretely, we consider ordinals
less than $\varepsilon_0$ as they can be represented by binary trees.
To see this, recall that every ordinal $\alpha$ can be written in
Cantor normal form
\begin{align*}
  \alpha &= \omega^{\beta_1} + \omega^{\beta_2}  + \dots + \omega^{\beta_n}
\end{align*}
for some $n\ge0$ and ordinals $\beta_i$ such that
$\beta_1\ge\beta_2\ge \dots \ge \beta_n$. If $\alpha < \varepsilon_0$,
then it can be shown that each exponent satisfies $\beta_i < \alpha$.
If we, again, write $\beta_i = \omega^{\gamma_1} + \dots +
\omega^{\gamma_m}$ in Cantor normal form, then clearly $\gamma_j <
\beta_i < \alpha$. As the ordering on ordinals is a well-order, we
know this decreasing sequence must terminate and we obtain a finite % and normalizing -> representation is unique
representation for each ordinal less than $\varepsilon_0$.

\citet{DBLP:conf/cpp/ForsbergXG20} developed Agda
formalizations for three equivalent representations for precisely this
set of ordinals. They define addition and multiplication of ordinals,
prove the principle of transfinite induction, and use that to prove
that the represented subset of ordinals is well-ordered.

We build on one of their representations, called MutualOrd, define
some additional operations, and prove some properties which are needed
in the context of universe levels.\footnote{Technically, the
  mechanization of \citet{DBLP:conf/cpp/ForsbergXG20} relies on
  cubical Agda \cite{XXX}. We back-ported the definitions for
  MutualOrd to standard Agda, as cubical is not needed for this representation.}
In particular, we prove the laws of a join-semilattice with an
inflationary endomorphism.

\subsection{Encoding Universes}
\label{sec:encoding-universes}

While Agda has built-in support for universes, it is possible to
``compress'' very general universe hierarchies into
$Set$. \citet{DBLP:conf/csl/Kovacs22} constructs a very general model
of cumulative universe hierarchies, which situated entirely in $Set_0$
and $Set_1$. The construction requires induction-recursion
\cite{DBLP:conf/tlca/DybjerS99}, so that the model can be constructed
in Agda along with its consistency proof.

Kovacs's construction is implemented in Agda along the lines of
\citet{mcbride15:_datat_datat}'s universe construction. Here we just
recall the most important definitions of his construction of TTDL
(type theory with dependent levels).

A \emph{level structure} provides a set $\ALvl$ of levels, a strict
linear order $<$, evidence that this order is propositional, and a
composition operator that embodies transitivity of the order.

The inductive type $U^{ir}$ of universe codes is defined mutually
recursively with its interpretation $El^{ir}$ in $\ASet$.

\section{Running Example}
\label{sec:running-example}

As a running example for demonstrating various encodings, we consider
different extensions of finitely stratified System F
\cite{DBLP:journals/iandc/Leivant91}. More precisely, we start from an
intrinsically typed encoding of types and expressions, then we
construct denotational semantics for different encodings and discuss
their respective merits.

We choose this system as it is significant, presents non-trivial
challenges, and it has been studied in the literature. Our encoding of
syntax is inspired by \citet{DBLP:conf/mpc/ChapmanKNW19}, who develop
the syntactic metatheory of System-F$\omega$ (without
stratification). It has been  picked up by
\citet{DBLP:conf/tyde/Saffrich0W24}, who give denotational and operational semantics
for finitely stratified System-F and develop a logical relation for
it. \citet{DBLP:journals/pacmpl/HubersM23} use a similar syntax
representation for a finitely stratified version of System-F$\omega$
extended with qualified types. They also develop a denotational
semantics for their calculus. All these papers come with Agda
formalizations.
